## Where are the fabrication files?

Download all the fabrication files (`.stl` for 3D printing and `.dxf` for laser/CNC cut) following our [fabrication file guide](documentation/fabrication_files.md).

## Assembling the M Prime One

You can use the [assembled FreeCAD model](m_prime_one.fcstd) to help you build the machine or if you are comfortable installing modules in FreeCAD see the animated assembly files in our [manuals repository](https://github.com/M-Prime/M_Prime_One_manuals) (soon we will provide assembly videos).
